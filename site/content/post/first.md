title:  Ecoindex Fire

Fire behavior involves a complex set of variables, including weather, terrain and fuels.  Of these, only fuels are ultimately manageable.  For this reason, our Ecoindex Fire dynamic maps concentrate on two key aspects of fuels:
<ol>
  <li>Fuel Models - standardized descriptions of the key longer-term physical characteristics of fuel beds, such as the distribution of fuels horizontally and vertically.</li>
  <li>Fuel Moisture - expressed as percentage of dry weight, this variable changes daily based on prior recent weather conditions.  Low fuel moistures correlate to high fire risk, and high rates of spread.</li>
  </ol>
